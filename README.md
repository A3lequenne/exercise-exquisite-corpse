# The brave little monkey

A pack of monkeys is cruising around the trees in Costa Rica. They were going so fast that the smallest of the group couldnt keep with the past anymore. After finding himself alone, he knew he will have to overcome a lot of challenges to find the pack again.
Once upon a time, there was a peaceful kingdom nestled within the embrace of majestic mountains. Its inhabitants lived in harmony with the mystical creatures that populated these lands. Among them, the dragons stood out for their grandeur and power.
